# App Structure

The app uses Next.js App Router structure with the following key routes:

- [app/(home)/](mdc:app/(home)/) - Home page route (main page)
- [app/about-me/](mdc:app/about-me/) - About me page
- [app/portfolio/](mdc:app/portfolio/) - Portfolio showcase
- [app/pdf-viewer/](mdc:app/pdf-viewer/) - PDF CV viewer

The root layout [app/layout.tsx](mdc:app/layout.tsx) wraps all pages and includes global styling and SEO settings.
